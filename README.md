Docker provide for us incredible and amazing architecture to be able very fast develop and deploy not only specific application but the whole supporting infrastructure as well.

This repo contains simple examples of dockerfiles that can be used as starting point to dockerize your applications.
Each dockerfile contains only common configuration which will be enough to start.
All another specific configuration must be provided separately in each project.

Enjoy!
